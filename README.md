        <p>
            TrailBlazer is the plugin we didn't deserve but most definitely need. It has
            fundamentally transformed the way I use my text editor on a daily basis. Truely a
            beautifully simple plugin of the people, by the people, for Neovim users.

Do not blindly believe any quote on the internet, even though the one above is most certainly
accurate.

Navigating back and forth between multiple very specific points of interest in one or more files
spread over several windows can be a rather difficult task. Most of the time those spots are either
located too far apart within one file to do a quick relative jump or to use [leap.nvim][leap.nvim]
or are spread out between multiple documents but also not located at the same spot when using
[harpoon][harpoon] jumps. Remembering default Neovim mark names on a per buffer basis is annoying
and takes up valuable [RAM][ram-def-wikipedia] in your brain. Thus moving between those locations
within large projects can slow you down tremendously. TrailBlazer aims to solve this problem by
enabling you to leave trail marks as you navigate multiple files over different windows and buffers.
Quickly move along the trail you mark as you journey through your project and start working wherever
you left of right away whenever you need to. You can even use several immediate actions on your
trail marks that allow you to be even more efficient.

**NOTE: TrailBlazer is still in its early stages of development and there are still many features 
to come. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please open an issue.**

## üî® Requirements

* Neovim (**stable** or **nightly**) >= 0.8.0

TrailBlazer will usually support the current stable and nightly versions of Neovim. Older versions
will most likely still work, but are no longer tested.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install TrailBlazer through your favorite plugin manager:

```lua
-- Using packer
use({
    "LeonHeidelbach/trailblazer.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("trailblazer").setup({
            -- your custom config goes here
        })
    end,
})
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure TrailBlazer by passing a table to the `setup` function. The following options are
available and set by default:

```lua
-- Adjust these values to your liking
{
    lang = "en",
    trail_options = {
        -- Available modes to cycle through. Remove any you don't need.
        available_trail_mark_modes = {
            "global_chron",
            "global_buf_line_sorted",
            "global_chron_buf_line_sorted",
            "buffer_local_chron",
            "buffer_local_line_sorted"
        },
        -- The current / initially selected trail mark selection mode. Choose from one of the
        -- available modes: global_chron, global_buf_line_sorted, global_chron_buf_line_sorted,
        -- buffer_local_chron, buffer_local_line_sorted
        current_trail_mark_mode = "global_chron",
        verbose_trail_mark_select = true, -- print current mode notification on mode change
    },
    mappings = {
        nv = { -- Mode union: normal & visual mode. Can be extended by adding i, x, ...
            motions = {
                new_trail_mark = '<A-l>',
                track_back = '<A-b>',
                peek_move_previous_down = '<A-J>',
                peek_move_next_up = '<A-K>',
            },
            actions = {
                delete_all_trail_marks = '<A-L>',
                paste_at_last_trail_mark = '<A-p>',
                paste_at_all_trail_marks = '<A-P>',
                set_trail_mark_select_mode = '<A-t>',
            },
        },
        -- You can also add/move any motion or action to mode specific mappings i.e.:
        -- i = {
        --     motions = {
        --         new_trail_mark = '<C-l>',
        --         ...
        --     },
        --     ...
        -- },
    },
    hl_groups = {
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkCursor = {
            -- You can add any valid highlight group attribute to this table
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "Orange",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkNewest = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "LightBlue",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkGlobalChron = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "Red",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkGlobalBufLineSorted = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "LightRed",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkGlobalChronBufLineSorted = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "Olive",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkBufferLocalChron = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "Green",
            gui = "bold",
        },
        TrailBlazerTrailMarkBufferLocalLineSorted = {
            guifg = "Black",
            guibg = "LightGreen",
            gui = "bold",
        },
    },
}
```

### Trail mark selection modes

Trail mark selection modes allow you to switch between different modes of traversing and executing
actions on your trail marks. Thus far you can choose between the following modes:

| Mode                           | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `global_chron`                 | This is the default mode. Marks are traversed globally in chronological order.                    |
| `global_buf_line_sorted`       | Marks are sorted by their buffer id and globally traversed from BOF to EOF.                       |
| `global_chron_buf_line_sorted` | Marks are sorted chronologically, then by their buffer id and globally traversed from BOF to EOF. |
| `buffer_local_chron`           | Only current buffer marks are traversed chronologically.                                          |
| `buffer_local_line_sorted`     | Only current buffer marks are traversed from BOF to EOF.                                          |

## üíª User commands

Arguments annotated with `?` can be omitted. If omitted, the current window, buffer, cursor position
and the global trail mark stack will be used. All user commands use functions defined
within the main TrailBlazer API module [lua/trailblazer/init.lua][user_api] which can also be used
directly like this:

```lua
require("trailblazer").<function_name>(<args>)
```

| Command                            | Arguments                                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                        |

## üìö Documentation

You can find the technical documentation for TrailBlazer under [doc/trailblazer.nvim.txt][help]. If
you are within Neovim you can also open the documentation by running `:help trailblazer`.

## üë• Contributing

I would like to keep TrailBlazer's code base as clean and easy to read as possible. If you would
like to contribute, please make sure to follow the following contribution guidelines and make sure
to add method documentations to your code:

### Linting

TrailBlazer uses [LuaCheck][luacheck] to lint the code base. You will have to install [Lua][lua] as
well as [LuaRocks][luarocks] to run and install [LuaCheck][luacheck]. To get started, simply follow
these steps:

Install [LuaCheck][luacheck] through [LuaRocks][luarocks]:

```console
$ luarocks install luacheck
```

After adding the [LuaRocks][luarocks] binary directory to your `$PATH` you can use this command to
lint the code:

```console
$ luacheck lua/ test/spec/
```

### Testing

TrailBlazer uses [busted][busted], [luassert][luassert] (through [plenary.nvim][plenary]) and
[matcher_combinators][matcher_combinators] to define tests in the `./test/spec` directory. If you
are planning to contribute, make sure all tests pass prior to creating a pull request.

Make sure your shell is in the `./test` directory or, if it is in the root directory,
replace `make` by `make -C ./test` in the commands below.

To initialize all test dependencies and execute the test suite simply run:

```console
$ make prepare
$ make test
```
